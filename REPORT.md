# ShearBite Project Report

## 1. Project Overview

ShearBite is a full-stack application designed to facilitate food donation and browsing. The platform allows users to register, log in, and manage food donations, including uploading images of the food items. The primary goal of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface for individuals and organizations to donate and receive food, reducing food waste and helping those in need.

## 2. Architecture

The application follows a microservices-based architecture, with separate services for the frontend and backend. The entire application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, ensuring a consistent and reproducible development environment.

### 2.1. System Components

- **Frontend:** A Next.js single-page application (SPA) that provides a rich and interactive user interface.
- **Backend:** A FastAPI application that exposes a RESTful API to the frontend for data management.
- **Database:** A PostgreSQL database is used for persistent data storage.
- **Object Storage:** MinIO is used for storing binary data, such as images of food donations.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Traefik is used as a reverse proxy to route incoming traffic to the appropriate service.

## 4. Setup and Installation

To set up and run the project locally, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivantana/shearbite.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd shearbite
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Create the database tables:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
   ```

Once the application is running, you can access it at the following URLs:

- **Frontend:** [http://localhost](http://localhost)
- **Backend API:** [http://api.localhost](http://api.localhost)
- **MinIO Console:** [http://minio-console.localhost](http://minio-console.localhost)

## 5. API Documentation

The backend API is well-documented using the OpenAPI standard. The documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and can be accessed at the following endpoints:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://api.localhost/docs](http://api.localhost/docs)
- **ReDoc:** [http://api.localhost/redoc](http://api.localhost/redoc)

## 6. Future Improvements
